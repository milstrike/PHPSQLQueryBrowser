You can use it like a MySQLQueryBrowser. But it executed in PHP.<br/>
<br/>
How to use it:<br/>
1. Make sure You ready with server (apache or nginx) and MySQL database.<br/>
2. Open index.php and make some configuration in database setting (servername, username, password)<br/>
3. Execute index.php through browser.<br/>
