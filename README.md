# PHPSQLQueryBrowser
MySQL Query Browser with PHP
\n
You can use it like a MySQLQueryBrowser. But it executed in PHP.\n
\n
How to use it:\n
1. Make sure You ready with server (apache or nginx) and MySQL database.\n
2. Open index.php and make some configuration in database setting (servername, username, password)\n
3. Execute index.php through browser.\n
\n
If, still confuse about configuration, see the screenshot.\n
\n
Thank You.
